	<h1>Topiary</h1>
	<p>
		Topiary provides tree and shape-based type verification for JavaScript.
	</p>

	<h2>Details</h2>
	<p>
		You can see the specification <a href="specs">here</a>, or the git repository <a href="https://github.com/caplin/topiary">here</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>A Note on implementation</h2>
	<p>
		This library makes liberal use of nonenumerable attributes and Object.getPrototypeOf.
		It is therefore suitable only for ecmascript 5 engines.  It will work in ecmascript 6
		engines but there would be a much nicer implementation in that case, using Map and
		private symbols.
